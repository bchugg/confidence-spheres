# Time-uniform confidence spheres 

This contains the code for the paper [Time-uniform confidence spheres for means of random vectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08168), published in _TMLR_ 2025. 

- subG.ipynb contains the code for the experiments on sub-Gaussian data (Figure 1 in the paper). 
- heavy_tails.ipynb contains the code the experiments on heavy-tailed data (Figure 2). 

No fancy packages or anything. Everything should run smoothly. Let me know if not.
